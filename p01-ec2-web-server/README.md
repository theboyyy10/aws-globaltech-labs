*Ticket HD-101* from Tunde Bello, Head of Sales
>
	⁠"Investors are visiting on Thursday and I want to show them a live Globaltech web page running on our own cloud server, not a free website builder. It only needs to be a single page for now. Plain HTTP is fine. Also, I want an email if the server is ever working too hard."

    **PROMPT**
    I have an Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance running Apache. Its user data script builds /var/www/html/index.html using IMDSv2 metadata (instance ID, availability zone, public IP).
    Write a new bash script named update-page.sh that I will run manually with sudo on the instance. It must:
    1.⁠ ⁠Get an IMDSv2 token, then read instance-id, instance-type, placement/region, placement/availability-zone and public-ipv4.
    2.⁠ ⁠Rebuild index.html for a company called Globaltech with a heading, a short welcome paragraph, and a table showing those five values.
    3.⁠ ⁠Add the current date and time of the update at the bottom of the page.
    4.⁠ ⁠Use only bash and curl, which are already installed.
    Add a comment above every block explaining what it does.
